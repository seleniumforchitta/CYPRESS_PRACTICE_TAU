Hey, my name is Chittaranjan, and I'm a Cypress ambassador and educator.

I like to teach testers about web development and developers about testing.

In this course, I would like to teach you about Cypress basics.

We're going to take a look into:

how to start a new Cypress project
how to write your first test
write simple assertions
learn a little bit about fundamentals that will give you a good start in writing great end-to-end tests
If you are a beginner, you've come to the right place.

We are going to keep things simple.

If, however, you get lost or confused at any point, don't hesitate to find me on the Test Automation University Slack channel, where I will always be happy to help you out or to answer any questions.

If you are hungry for more, make sure to check out the free advanced Cypress course that you can find right here on the Test Automation University.

I'm thinking you're going to enjoy this course very much and I hope that you'll have at least as much fun going through it as I had creating it.

Now let's go ahead and learn something new.

Update - 

Hey, welcome to Advanced Cypress course on Test Automation University!

My name is Chittaranjan, I teach testers about web development and developers about testing, and I will be teaching you about Cypress and some advanced concepts.

In this course, I'm going to explain some of the concepts that might become useful once you have all the basics covered. We'll be talking about advanced assertions, different ways of testing API, network mocking, creating custom commands, and so much more. We'll talk about Node.js and how it is utilized in Cypress. We'll talk about how to properly authenticate, and we'll finish off with a basic setup of GitHub Actions.

This course has a companion repository that you can clone to your computer and follow along. You can find a link in the resources section in this video. The repository contains same examples that I use, plus the application that I'm testing. All the installation instructions are in the README file, but if you struggle at any point, feel free to reach out to me on TAU Slack.
